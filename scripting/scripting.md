# Scripting

Scripting is the process of writing a series of commands or instructions in
a programming or scripting language to automate a task or a series of tasks.
A script is a standalone program that can be executed directly by a scripting
engine or interpreter, without the need for compilation.

Scripting languages are often used for tasks such as automating system administration,
data processing, and web development. Some popular scripting languages include
Python, JavaScript, Bash, and PowerShell.

Scripting can also refer to the process of creating a script for a movie,
play, or television show, which outlines the dialogue, actions, and scenes
that will occur.
