# Bash

Bash, which stands for "Bourne-Again SHell," is a command-line interface and
scripting language for Unix-based operating systems. It was created as an
improvement on the original Bourne Shell (sh), and is now one of the most
widely used shells on Linux and macOS systems.

Bash allows users to interact with their computer's operating system by typing
commands at the command prompt. It also provides a scripting language that
allows users to automate tasks by creating scripts, which are essentially
text files containing a series of commands that can be executed in sequence.

Bash is particularly useful for tasks such as file management, system administration,
and software development. It supports a wide range of features, including
variables, functions, conditional statements, and loops, making it a powerful
tool for both beginners and experienced users.
