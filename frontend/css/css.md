# CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used for describing
the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It's a cornerstone
technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

Here are some key features of CSS:

- Styling: CSS is used to control the style of an HTML document in terms
of colors, fonts, spacing, layout, etc. It allows you to separate presentation
from content, enhancing content accessibility, providing more flexibility
and control in the specification of visual characteristics, and enabling
multiple pages to share formatting.

- Selectors: CSS uses selectors to bind style properties to HTML elements.
A selector is a pattern that matches against elements in a tree, and a declaration
block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

- Cascading Order: The "cascading" nature of CSS means that multiple style
sheets can be applied to the same webpage, and they will be merged together
in a specific order. This allows for a high level of customization and flexibility.

- Responsive Design: CSS enables responsive web design, which allows web
pages to render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

- Box Model: CSS uses a box model for layout. Every element in CSS is a box,
and these boxes can be padded, styled, and positioned according to the visual
needs of the web page.

CSS is an essential tool for web developers and designers, providing the
ability to create visually engaging and responsive web pages. It's used
in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create rich, interactive web
experiences.
