# React

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
primarily for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer
in web and mobile apps. React allows you to design simple views for each state
in your application, and it will efficiently update and render the right
components when your data changes.

React was developed by Facebook, and it's maintained by Facebook and a community
of individual developers and companies. Here are some key features of React:

- Components: React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage
their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. This makes your code
more predictable and easier to debug.

- Virtual DOM: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the
resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.
This allows a special feature that leads to faster and efficient updates
of the user interface.

- JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax that allows quoting HTML and using HTML tag
syntax to render subcomponents. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML
structures in your JavaScript code.

- Lifecycle Methods: React components have lifecycle methods that you can
override to run code at particular times in the process.

- React Native: React isn't just for web applications. React Native, a framework
derived from React, lets you build native mobile apps using only JavaScript.
It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from
declarative components.

React is widely used in web development due to its flexibility and performance.
It's a great choice for building large applications that can change over time.
