# Frontend

This folder is meant to keep track of the frontend languages, good practices
and tools and tips.

## Langages

- [html](html/html.md)
- [javascript](javascript/javascript.md)
- [VueJS](vueJS/vueJS.md)
- [TypeScript](typeScript/typeScript.md)

## Tools

- [Open UI](https://github.com/wandb/openui): OpenUI let's you describe UI
using your imagination, then see it rendered live. You can ask for changes
and convert HTML to React, Svelte, Web Components, etc. It's like v0 but open
source and not as polished.
