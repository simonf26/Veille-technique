# Project management

Project management is the practice of planning, organizing, and overseeing
the execution of a project, in order to achieve specific goals and objectives.
It involves managing resources, timelines, budgets, and stakeholders, in order
to deliver a project on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

Project management typically involves several stages, such as:

- Initiation: This involves defining the project goals, objectives, and scope,
and obtaining approval from stakeholders.
- Planning: This involves developing a detailed plan for the project, including
timelines, budgets, resources, and deliverables.
- Execution: This involves carrying out the project plan, managing resources,
and monitoring progress.
- Monitoring and controlling: This involves tracking project performance, identifying
and managing risks, and making adjustments as needed to ensure that the project
stays on track.
- Closure: This involves completing the project, delivering the final product
or service, and conducting a post-project review to identify lessons learned.

Project management is an important practice for software development, as it
helps teams to deliver complex projects on time, within budget, and to the
required quality standards. It also helps to ensure that stakeholders are
engaged and informed throughout the project, and that risks are identified
and managed effectively.

Tools and technologies commonly used in project management include project
management software, collaboration tools, and communication tools. Some popular
examples of project management tools include Jira, Trello, Asana, Microsoft
Project, and Basecamp. These tools can be used to manage projects of various
sizes and complexities, from small agile projects to large waterfall projects.
