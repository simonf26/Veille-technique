# WhatTheDuck

WhatTheDuck is an open-source web application built on DuckDB, designed to
allow users to upload CSV files, store them in tables, and perform SQL queries
on the uploaded data. The application also provides the functionality to
download filtered results in CSV format, supports uploading multiple files,
and enables users to perform join queries. It's important to note that the
application stores data temporarily in memory, and refreshing the page will
clear all uploaded data.
