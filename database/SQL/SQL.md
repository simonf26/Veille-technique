# SQL

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language
designed to manage and manipulate data stored in relational database management
systems (RDBMS). It's a standard language for interacting with such databases,
including creating, modifying, and extracting data from them.

Here's a simple breakdown of what SQL can do:

- Create and modify database structures: SQL commands like CREATE, ALTER, and
DROP can be used to create new databases, tables, and other structures, as
well as modify or delete existing ones.

- Insert data: The INSERT INTO command is used to add new records into a table.

- Query data: The SELECT command allows you to retrieve data from one or more
tables. You can filter and sort this data using WHERE and ORDER BY clauses,
among others.

- Update data: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing records in a
table.

- Delete data: The DELETE command is used to remove records from a table.

- Control access to data: SQL also includes commands to control who has access
to data and what they can do with it, such as GRANT and REVOKE.

SQL is a powerful tool for managing data, and it's widely used in various
industries, from tech to finance to healthcare, and more. It's a valuable
skill for anyone working with data.

runtime that provides developers with a unified SQL query interface to locally
materialize, accelerate, and query datasets sourced from any database, data
warehouse, or data lake.
