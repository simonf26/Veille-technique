# Migration

## Definition

Data migration for a database is the process of transferring data between
different storage types, formats, or systems. This typically involves several
key steps:

- Assessment and Planning:
    - Assessment: Evaluate the current database schema, data volume, and data
    quality.
    - Planning: Develop a migration plan that includes timelines, resources,
    and risk management strategies.

- Data Extraction:
    - Extract data from the source database. This can involve exporting data
    to files (e.g., CSV, JSON) or using database tools to directly access 
the data.

- Data Transformation:
    - Transform the extracted data to fit the schema and requirements of the
    target database. This may involve data cleaning, normalization, and mapping
    fields from the source schema to the target schema.

- Data Loading:
    - Load the transformed data into the target database. This can be done
    through bulk loading tools, SQL scripts, or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
    tools.

- Validation:
    - Validate the migrated data to ensure it is accurate, complete, and consistent
    with the source data. This can involve running queries, comparing data
    samples, and performing integrity checks.

- Testing:
    - Test the migrated data and the new system to ensure that all functionalities
    work as expected. This includes performance testing, user acceptance testing,
    and regression testing.

- Cutover:
    - Switch from the old system to the new system. This can be done in phases
    or all at once, depending on the complexity and criticality of the data.

- Post-Migration Activities:
    - Monitor the new system to ensure it is functioning correctly.
    - Address any issues that arise post-migration.
    - Document the migration process for future reference.

Key Considerations:

- Data Integrity: Ensuring that data remains accurate and consistent throughout
the migration process.
- Performance: Assessing the impact of the migration on system performance.
-  Security: Ensuring that data is securely transferred and that access controls
are properly configured in the new system.
- Downtime: Minimizing the downtime during the migration to avoid disruption
to business operations.
- Rollback Plan: Having a plan to revert to the old system if the migration
fails.

Tools and Techniques:

- ETL Tools: Tools like Talend, Informatica, and Pentaho that facilitate the
extraction, transformation, and loading of data.
- Database Tools: Tools provided by database vendors (e.g., SQL Server Data
Tools, Oracle Data Pump) for data migration.
- Scripting: Using SQL scripts or other programming languages to automate parts
of the migration process.

In summary, data migration for a database is a structured process that involves
careful planning, execution, and validation to ensure that data is accurately
and efficiently transferred from one system to another.
