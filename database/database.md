# Database

A database, in the context of a project, is an organized collection of data
stored and managed in a computer system. It is designed to hold and manage
large amounts of information in a way that allows for efficient retrieval,
addition, and modification. A database typically consists of one or more tables,
which are made up of rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. Each row
represents a unique record, and each column represents a specific field within
that record. The purpose of a database in a project can vary, but it often
serves as a central repository for storing, managing, and analyzing data that
is relevant to the project's goals and objectives. This could include customer
information, product inventory, financial transactions, or any other type
of data that needs to be tracked and managed.
