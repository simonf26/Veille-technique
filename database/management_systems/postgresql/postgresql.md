# Postgres

PostgreSQL, often simply called Postgres, is a powerful, open-source object-relational
database system (ORDBMS). It uses and extends the SQL language combined with
many features that safely store and scale complicated data workloads.

PostgreSQL is known for its robustness, advanced features, and strong standards
compliance. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying,
making it a versatile choice for a variety of data management needs.

Some of its key features include:

- Data Integrity: PostgreSQL ensures data integrity through various constraints,
rules, triggers, and functions.

- Extensibility: Users can customize PostgreSQL by adding new functions,
operators, types, and even languages.

- Performance: It offers high performance, especially for complex queries,
through its sophisticated query planner/optimizer.

- Replication: PostgreSQL supports various methods of replication, providing
high availability and scalability.

- Security: It provides robust security features, including role-based access
control, row-level security, and data encryption.

PostgreSQL is used by many large and small organizations, including governments,
universities, and tech companies, to manage their data. It's a great choice
for a wide range of applications, from simple single-machine databases to
complex, internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.
