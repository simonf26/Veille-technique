# Cloud

Cloud typically refers to cloud computing, which is the delivery of on-demand
computing resources, particularly data storage and computing power, over the
internet. Instead of relying on local servers or personal computers, cloud
computing allows data and applications to be accessed and managed from anywhere,
at any time, as long as there is an internet connection. This provides scalability,
flexibility, and cost efficiency, as resources can be adjusted based on the
project's needs, and users only pay for what they use. It also facilitates
collaboration, as team members can access and work on the same data or project
from different locations.
