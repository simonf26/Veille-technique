# Robotics

Robotics is a branch of technology that deals with the design, construction,
operation, and application of robots. These robots are often automated machines
capable of performing tasks either autonomously or under human guidance, typically
in places where humans cannot or prefer not to go. Robotics combines various
fields of study, including engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence,
and more, to create machines that can interact with their environment and
perform complex tasks.
