## Coding & Co-coding

- [Plandex](https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex): Plandex uses long-running
agents to complete tasks that span multiple files and require many steps. It
breaks up large tasks into smaller subtasks, then implements each one, continuing
until it finishes the job. It helps you churn through your backlog, work with
unfamiliar technologies, get unstuck, and spend less time on the boring stuff.

local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and
not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple
model families. Does not require GPU.
