# Json

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data interchange
format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to
parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming
Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition, but is language-independent, making
it a popular choice for data exchange between different programming languages
and platforms.

JSON represents data structures using two main types: objects and arrays. Objects
are enclosed in curly braces {} and consist of key-value pairs, where keys
are strings and values can be strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays,
or null. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets [] and contain ordered lists
of values, which can be of any type mentioned above.

JSON is commonly used for communication between a client and a server in web
applications, as well as for configuration files and storing simple data structures.
Its simplicity and wide adoption make it a versatile and convenient choice
for data representation and exchange.
