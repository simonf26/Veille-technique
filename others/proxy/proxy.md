# Proxy

A proxy is a server or a software application that acts as an intermediary
between a client (e.g., a computer user) and another server from which the
client is requesting a service. The proxy receives the client's request, processes
it, and then communicates with the target server on behalf of the client.

Proxies are used for various purposes, including:

- Security: Proxies can provide an additional layer of security by hiding
the client's IP address and other identifying information from the target
server. This can help prevent cyberattacks and protect the client's privacy.
- Content filtering: Proxies can be used to filter or block access to certain
websites or online content. This is often done to enforce company policies,
protect users from harmful content, or comply with legal requirements.
- Caching: Proxies can cache frequently accessed content, such as web pages
or files, to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage. When a client
requests content that is already cached, the proxy can serve it directly, without
needing to retrieve it from the target server.
- Load balancing: Proxies can distribute incoming client requests across multiple
servers, helping to balance the load and improve the performance and reliability
of a service.
- Anonymity: Proxies can be used to browse the internet anonymously, as they
can hide the client's IP address and location from the target server. This
can be useful for accessing content that is restricted to certain regions
or for protecting the user's identity.

Overall, proxies can provide a range of benefits, including improved security,
performance, and privacy, as well as greater control over access to online content.

## Tools

- [Piko](https://github.com/andydunstall/piko): Piko is a reverse proxy to
connect to external networks. It can be used to expose services in a customer
network, as a bring-your-own-cloud service, or to connect to IoT devices.
