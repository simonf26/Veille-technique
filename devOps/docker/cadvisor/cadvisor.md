utilization.

Key Features:

- Container Metrics: cAdvisor collects and displays detailed metrics about
running containers, including CPU, memory, network, and file system usage.
- Docker Integration: cAdvisor integrates seamlessly with Docker, allowing
operators to monitor Docker containers without any additional configuration.
- REST API: cAdvisor provides a REST API that allows operators to query
container metrics and retrieve performance data.
- Web UI: cAdvisor includes a web-based user interface that provides a graphical
view of container performance data.
- Alerts: cAdvisor can be configured to send alerts when container resource
usage exceeds certain thresholds.

In summary, cAdvisor is a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing the
performance of running containers. It provides detailed metrics about container
resource usage, integrates seamlessly with Docker, and includes a web-based
user interface and REST API for easy access to performance data. cAdvisor
is an essential tool for operators who want to optimize container performance
and ensure the reliability and scalability of their containerized applications.
