# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that collects
and stores time-series data from applications and infrastructure. It provides
a flexible query language for analyzing and visualizing this data, and supports
alerting based on custom rules.

Key Features:

- Time-Series Data Collection: Prometheus collects and stores time-series
data from applications and infrastructure, including metrics such as CPU usage,
memory usage, and request latency.
- Flexible Query Language: Prometheus provides a powerful query language,
called PromQL, for analyzing and visualizing time-series data. PromQL allows
developers to filter, aggregate, and transform data in real-time.
- Alerting: Prometheus supports alerting based on custom rules, allowing developers
to define thresholds and conditions for triggering alerts. Alerts can be sent
to various notification systems, such as email, Slack, and PagerDuty.
- Service Discovery: Prometheus supports service discovery, allowing it to
automatically discover and monitor new services as they are added to the infrastructure.
- Integrations: Prometheus integrates with a wide range of applications and
infrastructure components, including Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS.

In summary, Prometheus is a powerful monitoring and alerting system that collects
and stores time-series data from applications and infrastructure. It provides
a flexible query language for analyzing and visualizing this data, and supports
alerting based on custom rules. Prometheus is an essential tool for developers
and operations teams who want to monitor and troubleshoot complex, distributed
systems.
