# Continuous delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development practice in which code changes
are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to a production
environment, but the actual deployment is triggered manually. It is an extension
of continuous integration, which focuses on automating the build and testing
processes.

In continuous delivery, every change that is committed to the code repository
is automatically built and tested, and if the tests pass, the changes are
packaged into a release artifact that can be deployed to production at any
time. This allows developers to quickly and easily prepare new releases, and
to deploy them to production with a high degree of confidence.

Continuous delivery relies on a high degree of automation, as well as a strong
focus on testing and quality assurance. Developers must ensure that their
code changes are thoroughly tested and validated before they are packaged
into a release artifact, in order to minimize the risk of introducing bugs or other issues.

Continuous delivery can provide many benefits, such as faster time-to-market,
improved quality and reliability, and reduced risk of errors and delays. However,
it also requires a high degree of collaboration and coordination between development,
testing, and operations teams, as well as a strong focus on automation, testing,
and monitoring.

Tools and technologies commonly used in continuous delivery include automated
testing frameworks, continuous integration servers, deployment automation
tools, and infrastructure as code tools. Some popular examples of continuous
delivery tools include Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, and GitLab CI/CD. Continuous
delivery is often seen as a stepping stone towards continuous deployment, as
it enables teams to deploy changes to production quickly and easily, while
still maintaining a high degree of control over the deployment process.
