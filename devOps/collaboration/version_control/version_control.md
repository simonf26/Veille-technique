# Version Control

Version control tools, also known as revision control tools, are software
applications that help developers manage changes to source code over time.
They provide a centralized repository for storing code, tracking changes, and
collaborating with other team members.

Version control tools allow developers to keep a history of all changes made
to the codebase, including who made the changes, when they were made, and
why they were made. This makes it easier to revert back to previous versions
of the code if necessary, and to track down bugs and other issues. Version
control tools also enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase
simultaneously, without overwriting each other's changes.

Some common features of version control tools include branching and merging,
which allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes in isolation,
and then merge their changes back into the main codebase when they are ready.
Version control tools also typically include tools for resolving conflicts,
comparing changes between different versions of the code, and managing access
controls and permissions.

Some popular examples of version control tools include Git, Mercurial, and
Subversion. These tools can be used individually or in combination with other
DevOps collaboration tools, depending on the specific needs and goals of the
project.
