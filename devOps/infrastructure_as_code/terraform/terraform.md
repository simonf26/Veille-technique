# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool created
by HashiCorp. It enables developers and DevOps engineers to define, manage,
and version infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language.
With Terraform, you can create, modify, and delete resources across various
cloud providers, on-premises data centers, and other service providers in
a consistent and reproducible manner. This makes it easier to manage infrastructure,
maintain version control, and collaborate on infrastructure changes, ultimately
leading to more efficient and predictable deployments.
