# Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a practice in which infrastructure, such as
servers, networks, and storage, is defined and managed using code, rather
than manual configuration. The goal of IaC is to automate the process of infrastructure
deployment and management, so that it can be done in a consistent, repeatable,
and scalable way.

In IaC, infrastructure is defined using configuration files, which specify
the desired state of the infrastructure in a declarative way. These configuration
files are then used by automation tools, such as Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation,
to create, update, or delete infrastructure resources automatically.

IaC provides several benefits, such as:

- Consistency: Infrastructure is defined and managed using code, which ensures
that it is consistent across different environments and deployments.
- Repeatability: Infrastructure can be deployed and managed in a repeatable
way, which reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies.
- Scalability: Infrastructure can be scaled up or down automatically, based
on demand, which makes it easier to manage large and complex systems.
- Version control: Infrastructure configuration files can be versioned and
tracked using version control systems, such as Git, which makes it easier
to manage changes and rollbacks.

IaC is an important practice for modern software development, as it enables
teams to deploy and manage infrastructure quickly and efficiently, while maintaining
high levels of consistency, reliability, and security. It also enables teams
to adopt DevOps practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery,
by automating the infrastructure deployment and management process.

Tools and technologies commonly used in IaC include infrastructure automation
tools, configuration management tools, and cloud providers. Some popular examples
of IaC tools include Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and AWS CloudFormation.
IaC can be applied to various types of infrastructure, such as virtual machines,
containers, and serverless functions.
