# Docker

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that enables developers
to package, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers.
Containers provide a consistent runtime environment for applications, allowing
developers to easily move applications between different environments, such
as development, testing, and production.

Key Features:

- Containerization: Docker provides a lightweight, portable, and isolated
environment for running applications. Containers share the host operating
system, but have their own file system, network, and process space.
- Image Management: Docker provides a registry for storing and sharing container
images. Developers can create their own images, or use pre-built images from
the Docker Hub or other registries.
- Orchestration: Docker provides tools for managing and orchestrating containers,
such as Docker Compose and Docker Swarm. These tools allow developers to define
and deploy multi-container applications, and manage their lifecycle.
- Networking: Docker provides a virtual network stack for containers, allowing
them to communicate with each other and with the host.
- Security: Docker provides various security features, such as seccomp profiles,
AppArmor, and SELinux, to isolate and protect containers.

In summary, Docker is a powerful containerization platform that enables developers
to package, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers.
It provides a consistent runtime environment for applications, and includes
tools for image management, orchestration, networking, and security. Docker
is an essential tool for modern application development and deployment,
and is widely used in cloud-native and microservices architectures.
