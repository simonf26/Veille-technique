# Glasskube

Glasskube will help you to install your favorite Kubernetes packages using
the Glasskube UI for reduced complexity and increased transparency. We are
also providing a brew inspired CLI for advanced users. Our packages are dependency
aware, as you would expect from a package manager. Designed as a cloud native
application, so you can follow your GitOps approach.
