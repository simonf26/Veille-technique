# Monitoring and logging

Monitoring and logging are two important practices in software development
that help teams to track the performance, availability, and security of their
applications and systems.

Monitoring refers to the process of collecting and analyzing data about the
performance and behavior of an application or system, in order to identify
issues or trends. This can include metrics such as response time, error rates,
CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and more. Monitoring tools can provide
real-time alerts and notifications when issues are detected, so that teams
can respond quickly to prevent or mitigate outages or other problems.

Logging refers to the process of recording events and activities that occur
within an application or system, in order to provide a historical record of
what happened. This can include information such as user activity, system
events, errors, warnings, and more. Logging tools can help teams to diagnose
issues, troubleshoot problems, and identify security threats by providing
detailed information about what happened and when.

Together, monitoring and logging provide a comprehensive view of the performance,
availability, and security of an application or system. They help teams to
identify and resolve issues quickly, improve the reliability and performance
of their applications, and ensure compliance with regulatory and security
requirements.

Tools and technologies commonly used in monitoring and logging include application
performance monitoring (APM) tools, log management tools, and analytics tools.
Some popular examples of monitoring and logging tools include Datadog, New Relic,
Splunk, Loggly, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). These tools
can be used to monitor and log data from various sources, such as applications,
servers, networks, and databases.
