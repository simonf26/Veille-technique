# Openapi

OpenAPI, formerly known as Swagger, is an open-source software framework backed
by the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI). It allows developers to create, describe,
and document APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in a standard, language-agnostic
manner.

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a set of files required to describe
such an API. These files can be used to generate documentation, client libraries,
and server stubs, among other things. This makes it easier for developers
to understand how to use the API, and it also facilitates automated API testing
and code generation.

The OpenAPI Specification supports various formats, including JSON and YAML,
for the API definition. This definition includes information about the API's
endpoints, request and response formats, authentication methods, and more.

In summary, OpenAPI is a toolset and a guideline that helps in designing,
building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs in a standard and organized
way.

## Tools

- [Openapi fuzzer](https://github.com/matusf/openapi-fuzzer) : Black-box fuzzer
that fuzzes APIs based on OpenAPI specification. All you need to do is to
supply URL of the API and its specification. Find bugs for free!
