# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice in which code
changes are automatically built and tested as soon as they are committed to
a shared code repository. The goal of CI is to catch integration issues early
and often, so that developers can fix them quickly and avoid delays and errors
later in the development process.

In a CI system, developers commit their code changes to a shared repository,
such as Git, on a regular basis. The CI server automatically detects these
changes, pulls the latest code from the repository, and builds and tests the
code. If the build or tests fail, the CI server notifies the developers so
that they can fix the issues quickly.

CI relies on a high degree of automation, as well as a strong focus on testing
and quality assurance. Developers must ensure that their code changes are
thoroughly tested and validated before they are committed to the repository,
in order to minimize the risk of introducing bugs or other issues.

CI can provide many benefits, such as faster feedback on code changes, improved
code quality and reliability, and reduced risk of errors and delays. It also
encourages collaboration and communication between developers, as they must
work together to integrate their code changes and resolve any issues that
arise.

Tools and technologies commonly used in CI include version control systems,
automated testing frameworks, continuous integration servers, and build automation
tools. Some popular examples of CI tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI,
and GitLab CI/CD. CI is often seen as a foundational practice for modern software
development, as it enables teams to develop and release software quickly and
efficiently, while maintaining high levels of quality and reliability.
