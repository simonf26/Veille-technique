# DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and
IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle
and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. Here are some
of its key components:

- Collaboration: This is the cultural aspect of DevOps. It emphasizes communication,
collaboration, and integration between software developers and IT operations
professionals.

- Continuous Integration (CI): This is a development practice where developers
regularly merge their code changes into a central repository. Automated builds
and tests are then run to detect integration issues early.

- Continuous Delivery (CD): This is an extension of CI, where code changes
are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
It can be manually deployed or progress to Continuous Deployment.

- Continuous Deployment: This practice automatically deploys all code changes
that pass the automated testing stage to the production environment, making
the software available to end users.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): This involves managing and provisioning computing
infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical
hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

- Monitoring and Logging: These are crucial for understanding system performance
and identifying issues. They involve tracking, collecting, and analyzing data
and metrics to provide insight into system operation and help in troubleshooting.

- Automation: This is key to achieving efficiency and consistency in DevOps.
It involves automating repetitive tasks such as deployment, testing, and building
to reduce human error and improve efficiency.

- Feedback Loop: This is the process of collecting and acting on feedback
from all stages of the software development and deployment process. It helps
in making continuous improvements.
